##Tips
1.  Envision the graph that you want to make before starting - draw a demo chart.  Make note of any variables over which you want to facet.
2.  Usually your data are not in the right "long" format for ggplot2 - use packages like reshape and plyr to format your data.  From your demo chart, make note of the anchoring variable (that is consistent across different treatments/categories,etc)
3.  Use qplot or ggplot for calling ggplot2, geom for determining the type of plot needed, and aes for linking visual aesthetics to the data.
