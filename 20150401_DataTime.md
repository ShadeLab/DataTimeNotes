##Dataset formatting
1.  work to zcore the environmental data - something up with decostand function in that average of standardized variables =! 0 (?)
2.  Explore JH dataset - original = 17 samples, 1000 OTUs; omit singletons and zeros to have a final dataset of 17 samples and 433 OTUs.
3.  Update:  decostand working propperly, all formatted input files (OTUs only, and OTUs + environmental data) are here:    https://github.com/ShadeLab/NetworkAnalysisWorkflows/tree/master/FormattingInputData

##MEN:  Ashley notes
1.  Tried to access MEN, had to register for a login, after registration the login failed, but on a second try (with an existing login), it worked.
2.  Formatting:  need to add “ID” to the OTU column ID


3.  web software interface



##SparCC:  Jackson notes
Fairly straightforward install;
Jackson made this change. 


##LSA:  Jeong-Hoon notes
Installation is a problem - RPY2 issues; must install legacy version RPY2 2.3.1
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpy2/2.3.1

##MIC:  Sang-Hoon notes
Updated R java, still

## WGCNA: Josh's Notes

[Paper Link from 2008](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/559)

[WGCNA Home Page](http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/)

[WGCNA R Tutorial](http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/FemaleLiver-01-dataInput.pdf)

R code I used to install WGCNA (Thanks to Paul for list of dependencies):
```
getCRANmirrors(all = FALSE, local.only = FALSE)
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/")))
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("bioDist")
biocLite("impute”)
biocLite("preprocessCore")
install.packages("WGCNA")
```

##Co-net:  Paul
GUi interface, weight metrics that you want to use in Cityscape, lots of options
install java, install cytoscape, and then add the plug-in Co-Net “cytoscape app"

The bottom line:  CoNet uses an “ensemble approach”, where it calculates multiple metrics (Pearson’s, Spearman, Kendall) and models pairwise OTU abundances using generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) with the multiple metrics as parameters. Their paper (attached) says that each by itself the regular metrics, like pearson’s, spearman and kendall, detect spurious correlations in compositional datasets. Log-ratio based metrics, including sparcc(), can work well with compositional data, but they make parametric statistics difficult, and usually resort to bootstrapping to calculate significance of detected correlations. Using GBLMs with multiple regular metrics minimizes compositional artifacts and allows for parametric statistics for significance calculations.

Platform: Full-on GUI through Cytoscape, although kind of busy and overwhelming. Point-and-click menus, check boxes, boxes for values, sliding scales. No fewer than 100 buttons.

Installation notes:
1. Install Java (from java site) version 7 or greater
2. Install Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php)
3. Open Cytoscape, go to app manager and install CoNet

Input data formatting notes
Correlations are computed for rows. Rows must be OTUs and columns are samples. Matrix must have a value in the upper left cell (I use “OTU”).
